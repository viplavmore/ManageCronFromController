# ManageCronFromController
This is used to manage all Cron Files from one centralized place.
In this script, CRONs are categorized based on 3 categories: DB, WEB & APP. 

The Cron file path is changes as per the OS family. Also, make sure that the name of the cron files must be same as the Hostname of the server so we can easily identify them.
